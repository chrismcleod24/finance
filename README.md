Harvard CS50 finance problem
Created a web app that allows users to pull live stock information from Yahoo finance API and "buy" or "sell" said stocks. 
Doesn't actually allow for buying or selling of stocks but does let you create a profile.
To keep track of cash and all stocks "bought" or "sold". Coded all in Python's Flask library, HTML, CSS and SQlite for the database.
